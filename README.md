# dAbot

CLI tool to automate stuff on DeviantArt.com

## Installation

1. [Install Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Python 2 will work too but it's not recommended)
2. Open Terminal/Command Prompt and enter `pip install dAbot`  
    If that doesn't work, try `python -m pip install dAbot`  
    If that doesn't work either, you're likely using Windows and you should reinstall Python making sure that the "Add in PATH" option is checked.
3. Once dAbot is installed, you can use any of the commands listed below by entering them in Terminal/Command Prompt.

To upgrade it later, run `pip install dAbot --upgrade`

```

1. Install a browser extension that can export a `cookies.txt` file. Here's one for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/njabckikapfpffapmjgojcnbfjonfjfg).
2. Go to DeviantArt.com and export the `cookies.txt` file for that tab only (or for DeviantArt.com only).
3. For `<cookies_txt_path>`, supply the path where the `cookies.txt` was exported/saved.  
     This should look something like `C:\Users\you\Downloads\cookies.txt` or `/Users/you/Downloads/cookies.txt`
4. After exporting cookies from your browser, you can clear your browser cookies for DeviantArt.com (or all cookies) so that your cookies aren't shared between the browser and the bot (which might create issues). You'll then have to login on your browser again and this will give your browser a fresh set of cookies.

If some command doesn't work, disable Eclipse and try again.

## Example

This will give me a llama:
```
dAbot /Users/you/Downloads/cookies.txt llama give Kishan-Bagaria
```

## Disclaimer

I don't intend to maintain this tool (except for some occasional changes). I developed this as a personal project back in 2014 and three years later, it wasn't doing much good sitting around, so I put it out here.  
It can be refactored a lot and sped up 100x using asynchronous connections. If you're a developer interested in hacking the code, you should definitely look into that.
